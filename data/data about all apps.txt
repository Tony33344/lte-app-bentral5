The apartment was exactly how described and very spacious. What could definitely be improved was the amount of utensils. There were only about 4 knives for an apartment for 7 and also no available dishcloth. Apart from that it was perfect for one night stay and I would definitely recommend it 😁👌🏻

The apartment looks just like in the pictures, though the shower is a bit worn (and it only had some men's shower gel). 
It’s spacious and located in a house with three other apartments, which could cause some parking issues. If all units are occupied, cars might be parked one behind the other, meaning you'd need to ask a neighbor to move their car if you want to leave. Personally, I don’t think that’s a reasonable setup. That said, we were lucky – during our one-night stay, we had no problems with parking.

Stayed a few nights
A nice relaxing place to stay!  A few things to be aware of before booking. If you are coming by car, the parking situation is a bit complicated. There are three properties in the building so while there are spots for all three, if all properties have a car you get blocked in. When we were leaving we had to wake up the other people staying so they could move their car so we could leave. 
Also it’s nice that there is a washing machine/ dryer but it is used by the property to clean the bedding, so often it was full and the laundry would sit for hours before anyone took it out. 
Also the communication with the host was sometimes unclear. Often the times listed were different for check in and check out times. We just relied on the times that Airbnb said. 
And lastly which was an unfortunate situation but when we were doing laundry another group was checking in and they were very confused, they asked us for help so we called the host. The host seemed very unhappy and raised his voice.

We had booked a room for 5 people & found bed linen & pillows for 4 :-( 
The one single bed needs to replace the sommier as it makes a lot of noise. 
The bathroom has a weird smell that comes out, while the shower needs attention so as not to have water all over the WC.
With a few adjustments it would be ideal for a family with 2 children.

    We hebben hier overnacht toen we onderweg naar huis (BiH) gingen. Onze 2 kinderen hebben samen een kamer gedeeld, hadden zelfs keuze in welk bed ze wilden. Onze baby had zelfs een eigen babybedje en kinderstoel. We hebben genoten van de rust, de fijne ruime ruimte en dat het niet te ver van de hoofdweg was.  Goed en snel contact met de host. Aanrader.

It smells like mould. The walls have mould. The location is far from the center. The sofa it’s just some wooden planks. You sleep like a prisoner. The sauna is ok I think. All in all the apartment is ok if you pay a lot less than 100 euro.

If Jernej contacts you last minute before your arrival, that there is some issue with the flat (water leak, piping issue or whatever), and he arranges a replacement accommodation at a different location just refuse it. 
He said he arranged the S Hotel, but when we got there, there was no one, no phone were picked up, just kids waiting at the front desk. 
Called the hotel number on and on, nothing happened, knocked office door, nothing. Contacted Jernej, nothing. Took a round trip in Maribor, and still no-one contacted back. 
Actually, Jernej contacted me 10-15 minutes after I told him that I suspect that he is a scammer and I asked for a refund. 
At the end I remained in the 40+ degrees after a 7 hours car drive with my girls without an agreed place. 
Airbnb took my call and got my money back - Jernej was displeased. 
Regardless to say how displeased I was.

The apartment is quite accurately described.  We stayed for one night, as a part of a longer journey, so couldn't evaluate everything. It's obvious though that the host is trying hard to keep guests happy. Thank you for that!

Nice apartment with the beautiful perk of having a sauna in the bathroom and a little patio in front of the entrance. Had everything we needed and check in was super easy. It’s a bit outside of the city - which was perfect for us since we were only trespassing through Maribor. Internet/WiFi didn’t have home office quality.
